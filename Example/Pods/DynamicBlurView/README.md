## Usage

### Example

Blur the whole

```swift
let blurView = DynamicBlurView(frame: view.bounds)
blurView.blurRadius = 10
view.addSubview(blurView)
```

Animation

```swift
UIView.animateWithDuration(0.5) {
    blurView.blurRadius = 30
}
```

Ratio

```swift
blurView.blurRatio = 0.5
```

### Variable

```swift
var drawsAsynchronously: Bool
```

- When true, it captures displays image and blur it asynchronously. Try to set true if needs more performance.
- Asynchronous drawing is possibly crash when needs to process on main thread that drawing with animation for example.
- Default is false.

```Swift
var blurRadius: CGFloat
```

- Strength of the blur.

```Swift
var trackingMode: TrackingMode
```

- Mode for update frequency.
- `Common` is constantly updated.
- `Tracking` is only during scrolling update.
- `None` is not update.

```swift
var blendColor: UIColor?
```

- Blend in the blurred image.

```swift
var iterations: Int
```

- Number of times for blur.
- Default is 3.

```swift
var isDeepRendering: Bool
```

- If the view want to render beyond the layer, should be true.
- Default is false.

```swift
var blurRatio: CGFloat
```

- When none of tracking mode, it can change the radius of blur with the ratio. Should set from 0 to 1.
- Default is 1.

```swift
var quality: CaptureQuality
```

- Quality of captured image.
- Default is medium.

### Function

```swift
func refresh()
```

- Remove cache of blur image then get it again.

```swift
func remove()
```

- Remove cache of blur image.
